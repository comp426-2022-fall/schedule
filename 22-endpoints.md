# User interaction endpoints

## 2022-11-17

### Agenda

> NOTE: The agenda for this session was to look at a full stack example for authenticating and interacting with users.
> Unfortunately, Zoom and room equipment malfunction destroyed that plan, so we returned to looking at user data endpoints with the time remaining.
