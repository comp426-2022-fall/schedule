### Notes

#### What is a dependency

- Code that relies upon another piece of code to execute
- Usually a package of code that simplifies life

#### Examples of dependency code

##### Npm

```
npm init
```

This creates a new npm project.

```
npm install <dependency>
```

- Adds code package to your project
- Can be referenced at any point at the top of your files
  - ‚ÄòUsing‚Äô / ‚Äòimport‚Äô / ‚Äò#include‚Äô / etc.

###### Express example

```
npm install express
```

Create new file, `<filename>.js` (replace `<filename>` with whatever name you like:

```
touch <filename>.js
```

Put this code in `<filename>.js`

```<filename>.js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
 
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.send('Hello World')
  })
 
  app.listen(3000)
```

Run it:

```
node <filename>.js
```

#### Dependency injection at runtime

- Copy and pastes code to top of file
- Invisible, unless viewed specifically by user in compiler

#### Dependency libraries

- Package.json file
- Trimming/adding dependencies for use

#### Creating your own dependencies

Create a new file `./modules/math.js`:

```
export function add(x, y) {
    return x + y
}
```
Create another new file `test.js`.

```
import {add} from "./modules/math.js"
 
console.log(add(1,2))
```

> Remember that in Node 16.x.x, you have to tell Node that this is an ESM package by adding `"type": "module"` to `package.json` (or renaming the file with the `.mjs` extension). Don't worry, though: the error messages will tell you precisely what you need to do.

#### The Good

- Don‚Äôt need to reinvent the wheel
- Reduces length of your code (kinda)
- Morally good copy-pasting of code

#### The Bad

- Circular dependencies
  - Clutters program with useless code, can propagate code, bad for testing, etc.
- Security issues
  - Coder negligence
  - Not know exactly what tools you are using
- Deprecation of packages
  - Based your entire code around ‚Äúcool-guy-code‚Äù dependency? Sorry kid, its gone. Have fun finding another package that perfectly fits.

#### Take-aways

- Dependencies are just packages of code and functions
- Dependency management is key to flawless code
  - Delete unnecessary dependencies!
- Always install dependencies when pulling from a repo
  - Use `npm install`
  - This links your dependencies as modules in Node
- Always know what you are working with when developing code using dependencies
- Dependencies are omnipresent in coding. You will have dependencies to work with, but you can understand them better.
