1. Forks and pull requests
2. Functions as library modules
3. Incorporating functions into endpoints

### Notes

#### In-class exercise

1. Make a fork of this repository: https://github.com/comp426-2022-fall/example-code
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
2. Create a `.js` file named whatever you wish to call it in the directory `./express/lib/`. Mine is called `random_number.js`. 
3. Write a function in your script file that returns some information. It can be a number, text, json, whatever.
4. Commit your code and push it.
5. Back in GitHub, create a pull request.

Together we will go through and merge them into the example-code repo.
